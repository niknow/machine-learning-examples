The case $\\alpha=0$ is equivalent to no smoothing applied, the case $0 < \\alpha < 1$ is called *Lidstone smoothing* and the case $\\alpha=1$ is called *Laplace smoothing*. The reason why we apply smoothing is that it is naive to assume that the training set we are given is the entirety of samples that can theoretically occur. This is particularly awkward if certain cases do not occur at all in the training set, as this will lead to a zero estimate for the corresponding probability. In particular for data sets with a large number of features, e.g. word counts in text classification, this is not uncommon. The simple solution is to increate every count by $\\alpha=1$, which is why this is also sometimes called *add-one smoothing*.

    "When implementing a Bayes model, one has a choice, which probabilities are directly estimated from data and which are calculated out of previous estimates. This might not always give the same result. For example assuming $X_0,Y_1,Y$ are all binary, $\\mathbb{P}[X_0=0,X_1=1\\mid Y=0]$ estimated by counting from the data might give a different result than multiplying the estimated values $\\mathbb{P}[X_0=0\\mid Y=0]\\mathbb{P}[X_1=1\\mid Y=0]$ even though mathematically this holds true under the assumptions of the model. This is because the estimation from the data has to work with finite samples and even if they are drawn from distributions that perfectly match the model assumptions, we get different values - and of course the model assumptions might not hold perfectly (or not at all). \n",
